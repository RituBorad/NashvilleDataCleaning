# NashvilleDataCleaning

Like our house, we love our data clean:)
This is a project showing data cleaning using SQL. 

Dataset link: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx

What I did?
- Standardizing date format
- Populating null property address
- Breaking property and owner address into new columns
- Standardizing ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ category

Having clean data will ultimately increase overall productivity and allow for the highest quality information in our decision-making.
